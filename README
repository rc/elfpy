ElfPy (Experimental lab fits in Python)
---------------------------------------

A collection of Python modules with a command line interface to
(semi-)automatically evaluate and fit curves from experimental measurements of
mainly biological tissues.

The purpose of elfpy is to make the evaluation of mechanical measurements of
soft biological tissues easier and to enable a (semi-)automatic determination
of mechanical properties of these kinds of tissues.

Run

$ python process.py -h

to get more help and then

$ python process.py -l

to see all available commands.
